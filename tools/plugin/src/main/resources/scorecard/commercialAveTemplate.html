            <h3>${testsuite} Scorecard for Commercial Tools</h3>

            <p>${testsuite} is a test suite designed to evaluate the speed, coverage, and accuracy of automated vulnerability detection tools. Without the ability to measure these tools, it is difficult to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and compare them to each other. ${testsuite} contains thousands of test cases that are fully runnable and exploitable. The following is the scorecard showing how well the commercial tools collectively performed against version ${version} of ${testsuite}. For each vulnerability it shows the lowest, average, and highest scores across all the commercial tools included in this scorecard calculation.</p>
